# UFOs

## Overview

Dana was tasked with creating a webpage to present all UFO sightings. She left off with only being able to 
filter the data by the date of the UFO sighting. In this challenge we were tasked with adding filters pertaining
to the state, city, country, and shape for people to better narrow down their searches.  

## Results

As a result of these new changes any individual visiting the site can search for a siting based on any number of 
criteria for example:

-Date, State:
![Date_State](https://github.com/Tbrads325/UFOs/blob/main/result_images/Date_State.png)
-State, Country:
![State_Country](https://github.com/Tbrads325/UFOs/blob/main/result_images/State_Country.png)
-Shape, State:
![Shape_State](https://github.com/Tbrads325/UFOs/blob/main/result_images/Shape_State.png)
-Shape, State, Country:
![Shape_State_Country](https://github.com/Tbrads325/UFOs/blob/main/result_images/Shape_State_Country.png)
## Summary

### Drawback:

- Unless the filter exactly matches a value in the table it will not return a result. For example, if a user searches for California sightings and uses CA instead of ca then the website will not 
return any results even though there are sightings in California.

### Recommendations:

- One recommendation would be to instead create dropdowns for the filters for users to easily see what values are available and select the sightings they are looking for. 

- Another recommendation would be to allow for multiple spellings for searches/filters in state/country/shape/city filters. This will assist with the drawback mentioned above.
